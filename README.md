<h1>RAD150 vs S23 – Which SARM Delivers More Size and Strength?</h1>

<p>I’ve run both <strong>RAD150</strong> and <strong>S23</strong> solo in real-world training cycles. These aren’t beginner SARMs. They’re both <strong>extremely potent</strong> and bring different things to the table. So in this article, I’ll walk you through how each one performed for me, what kind of results you can expect, and what they’re actually best for—<strong>bulking, cutting, or strength.</strong></p>

<p>This isn’t theory—these are my personal results based on real cycles, bloodwork, and gym progress. At the end of each section, I’ve added trusted links to the sources I use. Don’t roll the dice with shady vendors. These are the real deal.</p>

<h2>RAD150 (TLB-150) – Clean Size Gains with Long-Lasting Effects</h2>

<p><strong>RAD150</strong> is an esterified version of <strong>RAD140 (Testolone)</strong>, designed to stay active longer in your body. That means <strong>more stable blood levels</strong> and potentially smoother gains. I ran it at <strong>30mg/day for 8 weeks</strong> during a lean bulk.</p>

<h3>My Results on RAD150:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Solid muscle gains—around 6 lbs of lean mass</li>
  <li>Great strength increases on bench and overhead press</li>
  <li>No water retention or bloating</li>
  <li>Good recovery between sessions</li>
  <li>Mild suppression around week 6</li>
</ul>

<p>RAD150 felt like a cleaner, slower-burning RAD140. The strength and size gains came in strong around week 3. I didn’t experience any aggression or sleep disruption, which I sometimes get with RAD140. Just a <strong>calm, consistent gain</strong> with little to no crash post-cycle.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Longer half-life = more stable dosing</li>
  <li>Great for lean bulking</li>
  <li>No estrogen conversion or water retention</li>
  <li>Good strength-to-side-effect ratio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Some suppression by week 6</li>
  <li>Not ideal for cutting or extreme recomps</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Lean Bulking, Strength, Size</p>

<h2>S23 – Dry, Shredded, and Strong AF</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is one of the strongest SARMs I’ve tested. It’s known for <strong>hardening muscle, stripping fat, and increasing aggression</strong>. I used it during a hardcore cut at <strong>15mg/day for 6 weeks</strong>. It worked—but it was not easy on the body.</p>

<h3>My Results on S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Insane muscle definition and hardness</li>
  <li>Strength stayed the same or even increased while cutting</li>
  <li>Zero water retention—dry, grainy look</li>
  <li>Suppression hit fast (felt it by week 3)</li>
  <li>More aggression and sleep issues at higher doses</li>
</ul>

<p>S23 is for serious lifters only. If you’re prepping for a show, photo shoot, or summer cut—it gets you shredded fast. But <strong>it will suppress your testosterone</strong hard. I needed a full PCT after running this (Clomid + Nolva combo).</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Top-tier cutting SARM</li>
  <li>Extreme definition and vascularity</li>
  <li>Great for retaining strength in a deficit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong suppression (100% needs PCT)</li>
  <li>Sleep and mood swings if under-recovered</li>
  <li>Not great for beginners</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Contest Prep, Fat Loss</p>

<h2>RAD150 vs S23 – Which One Should You Use?</h2>

<p>Here’s a quick breakdown based on my experience using both solo:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SARM</th>
      <th>Best For</th>
      <th>Muscle Gain</th>
      <th>Fat Loss</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>RAD150</strong></td>
      <td>Lean Bulking</td>
      <td>8/10</td>
      <td>5/10</td>
      <td>Mild</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>S23</strong></td>
      <td>Cutting / Prep</td>
      <td>6/10</td>
      <td>10/10</td>
      <td>High</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you want <strongsteady muscle and strength</strong> gains with fewer side effects, RAD150 is the better pick. If you’re looking for a <strong>dry, cut, photo-ready physique</strong> and can handle suppression, S23 is the beast.</p>

<h2>My SARMs Testing Protocol</h2>

<p>Every compound I try is tested solo for 6–8 weeks. I track progress using:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before/after DEXA scans (body comp)</li>
  <li>Training logs (weights, reps)</li>
  <li>Bloodwork (testosterone, liver, lipids)</li>
  <li>Daily journal (side effects, sleep, recovery)</li>
</ul>

<p>I never stack two suppressive SARMs without knowing how each one hits me solo first. Trust me—bloodwork never lies.</p>

<h2>FAQs – RAD150 vs S23</h2>

<h3>Is RAD150 the same as RAD140?</h3>
<p>No. RAD150 is an esterified version, meaning it lasts longer in your system and has smoother effects.</p>

<h3>Does S23 shut you down?</h3>
<p>Yes. S23 is highly suppressive and almost always requires a proper PCT post-cycle.</p>

<h3>Can you stack RAD150 with S23?</h3>
<p>You could, but I wouldn’t unless you’re advanced and already know how each one hits you. Stacking two potent SARMs increases side effect risk.</p>

<h3>Which is stronger for fat loss?</h3>
<p>S23. It’s one of the best SARMs for cutting and muscle definition.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>RAD150 and S23 both deliver results—but in completely different ways. If you're chasing <strong>lean mass with stability</strong>, go RAD150. If you want <strong>hard, dry cuts and fat shredding</strong>, S23 is unmatched.</p>

<p>Whatever you choose, cycle smart, get bloodwork, and always have a plan for PCT. These compounds are powerful—and they deserve respect.</p>
